# Option_Pain
An excel dashboard to show :
a. long unwinding and short buildup in the ATM levels for both CE and PE
b. Paste the data from the nifty page and follow the comments to arrive at the current level of option pain. 
A similar structure for stock specific CE and PE has been also done but not tested extensively. 
An excel based option payoff simulator is also shared to give the user a feel about the payoff diagram visually
